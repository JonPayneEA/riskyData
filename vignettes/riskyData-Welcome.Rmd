# Introduction

Welcome to riskyData!  

The package `riskyData` has been developed for the Evidence and Risk colleagues to cleanly and reliably import data from the Environment Agencies API. 

## Using the package

```{r setup}
library(riskyData)
```

The `loadAPI()` function forms the basis of riskyData. Most operations relate in some mannner to this. To load a list of all the sites use;

```{r loadAll, eval = FALSE}
loadAPI()
```

Once you have identified a dataset of interest, such as Bewdley, we can inform the API to return all the available datasets assigned to the WISKI ID;

```{r datasets}
loadAPI(ID = '2001') #! It's good practice to input the ID as a character string
```
